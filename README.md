# Metreeca/Tool

Metreeca/Tool is a model‑driven TypeScript/React framework for rapid REST/JSON‑LD frontend development.

Its modules support declarative data management, infographics and self-service analytics built on
top of model‑driven REST/JSON‑LD APIs published with the companion [Metreeca/Link](https://github.com/metreeca/link)
backend framework.

While collectively providing a floor-to-ceiling frontend development solution, Metreeca/Tool modules are loosely
coupled and may be easily plugged as a specialized component into your toolkit of choice.
